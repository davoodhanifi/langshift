# AI LangShift

AI LangShift is an open source Chrome extension that instantly translates user-selected text on any webpage using the OpenAI API (GPT-4). With a simple keyboard shortcut, the extension retrieves the selected text, sends it for translation, and replaces it directly on the page.

## Features
- **Instant Translation:** Translate selected text with a single keyboard shortcut.
- **Customizable Settings:** Configure your OpenAI API key and preferred target language via the options page.
- **Wide Compatibility:** Works on standard webpages as well as in input fields and contenteditable elements.
- **Open Source:** Fully open source and hosted on GitHub, encouraging community contributions.

## Building & Development

- **TypeScript Compilation:**
The project is written in TypeScript. To compile the code, run:
    ```bash
    npx tsc
    ```

The build process includes a script that copies all static assets to the dist folder. Run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

- **Development Workflow:**
Make changes in the `src` folder and re-run the build script to see your updates reflected in the `dist` directory.
